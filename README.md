## Does government-backed lending prevent unemployment? An assessment of the Swiss Covid--19 lending program

**Abstract:**  This paper estimates the effect of government-backed credit supply on unemployment using regional variation in the Swiss Covid--19 lending program. To disentangle supply and demand effects, I exploit that the rules of the program introduce variation in credit supply across Cantons. Higher credit supply reduces unemployment. Increasing credit volume by CHF 100,000 saves between 0.16 and 0.27 jobs. Therefore, to save one job credit supply has to expand by between CHF 370,370 and CHF 625,000. Taking into account that some of these credits will not be repaid, saving one job costs the government between CHF 37,000 and CHF 62'500 per year.
